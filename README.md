# Water temperature gateway

This application is an API gateway for three Yr APIs:
1. https://www.yr.no/api/v0/regions returning countries with their IDs
2. https://www.yr.no/api/v0/regions/{countryId} returning regions by country ID
3. https://www.yr.no/api/v0/regions/{regionId}/watertemperatures returning water temperatures in a region by region ID 

The goal of the exercise is to perform review of this code. Would you merge it as is? Would you request changes?

Please download this repository, open in your favorite IDE and come to the interview with a laptop 
having this code ready for tweaking.
